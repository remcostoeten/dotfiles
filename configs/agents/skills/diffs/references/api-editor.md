| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `historyMaxEntries`      | Limits the undo stack.                                   |

| `initialState`           | Supplies partial or complete state on first attach.      |
| `keymap`                 | Adds shortcut groups checked before the defaults.        |
| `roundedSelection`       | Controls rounded selection corners.                      |
| `matchBrackets`          | Controls matching-bracket highlights.                    |
| `autoSurround`           | Controls quote and bracket insertion around a selection. |

| `enabledSelectionAction` | Enables the selection action surface.                    |
| `clipboard`              | Supplies a text clipboard reader.                        |
| `renderSelectionAction`  | Produces the selection action element.                   |
| `onAttach`               | Receives the editor and attached surface.                |
| `onChange`               | Receives the event, including its editor instance.       |
| `onComplete`             | Observes the completed file or diff event.               |
| `onFocus`                | Runs after the editor gains focus.                       |
| `onBlur`                 | Runs after the editor loses focus.                       |

For a `file-diff` editor, view-only `initialState` can omit document and diff
metadata. Transferring an edited document and its undo/redo history requires the
matching `document`, `fileInfo`, and `diffSession` from one complete
`EditState`.

`onComplete` receives the exact frozen event that is also passed to the
component's `onEditComplete` or CodeView's `onItemEditComplete`. The editor
observer runs first and still runs when the component callback is missing. You
cannot accept or reject from this API. It is here for symmetry, but most
integrations should use those component callbacks instead.

Use `editStateKey` for ordinary same-runtime restoration. It retains the draft,
undo/redo history, selections, horizontal code scroll, eligible vertical scroll,
and FileDiff resume metadata without an application synchronization loop. It is
bounded in-memory state and does not survive a reload.

Use `getViewState()` and `setViewState()` for an isolated selection/view copy or
durable application persistence. An attached surface reports horizontal
`scrollLeft`. It reports `scrollTop` only when `ownsVerticalViewport: true` was
passed to the constructor and the surface exclusively owns an element viewport.
Virtualization alone does not imply ownership; page, ancestor, and CodeView
shared scrolling remain application/viewer state.

`getEditState()` exposes the raw objects from the latest complete edit-lifecycle
checkpoint. Checkpoints run after synchronization, document edits, explicit
`setViewState()` calls, recycling, and completion. Selection or scroll movement
alone does not update it; use `getViewState()` for an exact live copy. State
remains available while rendering is recycled and during `onComplete`, and
returns `undefined` before synchronization or after completion. The result is
borrowed editor-owned state rather than a serialization format.

## `Editor` members

| Member                                                   | Purpose                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `new Editor(kind, options?, editStateKey?)`              | Creates an editor with optional keyed state retention. |
| `edit(instance)`                                         | Attaches and returns the normal completion disposer.   |
| `setOptions(options)`                                    | Merges editor options.                                 |

| `canUndo`                                                | Reports whether undo has an entry.                     |
| `canRedo`                                                | Reports whether redo has an entry.                     |
| `undo()`                                                 | Reverts the latest edit.                               |
| `redo()`                                                 | Reapplies the latest reverted edit.                    |
| `getFile()`                                              | Gets the current file contents.                        |
| `getText()`                                              | Gets the current text.                                 |
| `getViewState()`                                         | Gets selections and editor-owned view state.           |
| `setViewState(state)`                                    | Sets selections and editor-owned view state.           |
| `getEditState()`                                         | Gets the latest edit-lifecycle state checkpoint.       |
| `setSelections(selections)`                              | Sets directed selection ranges.                        |
| `setMarkers(markers)`                                    | Sets diagnostic markers.                               |
| `focus(options?)`                                        | Focuses the editor.                                    |
| `blur()`                                                 | Removes editor focus.                                  |
| `cleanUp(reason?: 'discard' \| 'recycle' \| 'complete')` | Suspends rendering or completes the editing session.   |

`editStateKey` opts an editor into retained in-memory sessions across editor
instances. File and file-diff namespaces are independent and each keeps up to
100 inactive entries by default. The same kind/key cannot be active in two
editors at once.

Call the disposer returned by `edit(instance)` for the normal session-ending
path; it is equivalent to `cleanUp('complete')` and installs an accepted
completion result. `cleanUp('discard')` still publishes the completion event but
does not install its result. `cleanUp('recycle')` suspends rendering without
ending the session or changing the editor-component association. Calling
`edit(instance)` again resumes rendering for that same component.

## `EditStateManager` members

| Member                              | Purpose                                                         |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get(kind, editStateKey)`           | Borrows active or inactive complete state without touching LRU. |
| `clear(kind, editStateKey, parts?)` | Clears inactive complete or granular state.                     |
| `clearAll()`                        | Clears all inactive state without mutating active editors.      |
| `setCapacity(capacity)`             | Sets each namespace's inactive retained-state capacity.         |

`clear()` returns `false` for active or missing state. Omit `parts` to remove
the complete entry. `{ document: true }` also removes the complete entry because
all other parts depend on it. Use `{ history: true }`, `{ selections: true }`,
`{ view: true }`, or `{ editor: true }` to keep the document while clearing undo
history, cursor state, scroll state, or both view-state parts respectively.

For durable persistence, store `FileContents` and optional JSON-safe
`EditorViewState` separately, then construct a fresh `TextDocument` when
restoring. Complete `EditState` and undo/redo history are not serialization
contracts.

| `getTextSlice(start, end)`                           | Gets text between two offsets.                        |
