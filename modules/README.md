# Modules

Feature-specific modules and plugins that can be independently developed and maintained.

This directory houses modular components organized by functionality.

## Structure

Each module follows the pattern:
```
module-name/
├── core/
├── shell/
│   ├── bash/
│   ├── fish/
│   └── zsh/
├── configs/
└── tests/
```
