Project Code Rules (must follow exactly):
- TypeScript types use "type" only; never "interface".
- All type names are prefixed with T. If a file contains exactly one non-exported type, name it TProps.
- React/Next.js: use function declarations only; no arrow functions; no classes; no "new" or "this".
- Predictable functional style: pure functions, immutable patterns, no shared mutable state.
- Exports: named exports only. Default exports are allowed only in Next.js pages and views.
- Pages return a View and optional Metadata only; Views live in /views or src/views and are named *-view.tsx.
- No comments in code. Prefer clear, self-explanatory names.
- No tests unless explicitly requested.
- Use bun exclusively when package tooling is required.

Output Format (for code responses):
- Provide a concise implementation plan first.
- Then provide file blocks using these markers for each file:
BEGIN_FILE path/to/file.ext
...file content...
END_FILE
- Include only files that need to be created or changed.
