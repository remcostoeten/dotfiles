[Response Instructions]
- Follow all Project Rules exactly.
- If creating a page: default export is allowed for the page component only; the page must only return a View and optional Metadata. The View must be in /views or src/views, named *-view.tsx.
- For component props: if the file has exactly one non-exported type, name it TProps. Use "type" and prefix other types with T.
- Use function declarations only; no arrow functions; no classes.
- Do not include comments.
- Return code changes as BEGIN_FILE/END_FILE blocks only, plus a brief implementation plan above.
