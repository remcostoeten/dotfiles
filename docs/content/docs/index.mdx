## Welcome to the Dotfiles Collection

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of dotfiles and development environment configurations designed to streamline and enhance the developer experience across different operating systems.

### 🎯 What This Provides

A modular, cross-platform development environment that includes:

- **Shell Configuration**: Fish shell setup with custom functions and aliases
- **Development Tools**: Node.js utilities, port management, and build scripts
- **Environment Management**: Cross-platform environment variable handling
- **Utility Scripts**: File operations, git helpers, and system management tools
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean, maintainable structure with separation of concerns

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/remco-stoeten/dotfiles.git ~/.config/dotfiles

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x ~/.config/dotfiles/bin/*

# Initialize environment (Linux/MacOS)
source ~/.config/dotfiles/env/loader.sh

# Or for Fish shell
source ~/.config/dotfiles/env/init.fish
```

### 📁 Repository Structure

The dotfiles are organized into logical modules:

```
~/.config/dotfiles/
├── bin/                 # Executable utilities and scripts
├── env/                 # Environment configuration per platform
├── configs/             # Application-specific configurations
